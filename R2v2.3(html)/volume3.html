<section><h3>Terminology</h3>
<section><h4>Definitions</h4>

<section><h5>Metadata</h5>
<p>This clause describes the metadata associated with various Open IPTV Forum services.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Linear TV metadata</b><br />Metadata that is associated with the content items provided in the Scheduled Content Service. In the Scheduled Content Service the content playout time is determined by the service provider.
<li><b>CoD metadata</b><br />Metadata describing the attributes of content items available to the user on an on-demand nature. The CoD Metadata is typically organised as a catalog which may be presented in different perspectives such as alphabetical listing or grouped by genre.
<li><b>Interactive Services metadata</b><br />Metadata describing interactive applications that may be available to the user.
<li><b>Stored Content metadata</b><br />Metadata describing scheduled content items that have been recorded by the user and are available for playback either from network storage or local storage.
<li><b>File Delivery metadata</b><br />Metadata describing a file delivery session over the unidirectional network.
</ul>
</section>
<section><h5>Metadata Formats</h5>
<p>The Open IPTV Forum metadata is based on two ETSI Standard specifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Service Discovery and Selection (SD&amp;S)</b><br />SD&amp;S Metadata is a set of data related to the Service Discovery and Selection (SD&amp;S) mechanism as defined by [[!SDNS]]. This metadata allows the OITF to retrieve information to select Linear TV services (i.e. multicast address, channel name, package ...), BCG services (for linear TV or CoD) or other DVB services. For FCC/RET services, the appropriate SD&amp;S records are defined in [[!FCC]].
<li><b>Broadband Content Guide (BCG)</b><br />The BCG is a set of data related to the description of Linear TV events and services, and/or CoD content as defined by [[!BCG]].
</ul>

<h2>Metadata Content</h2>
<p>This clause defines the Open IPTV Forum extensions to the SD&amp;S and BCG schemas and the AV classification schemes. Please refer to the SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] and BCG [[!BCG]] specifications for the base schemas.</p>
<section id="schema-extension-and-validation">
<h3>Schema Extension and Validation</h3>
<p>Open IPTV Forum metadata is in the form of instance document which is validated against a schema defined in this specification. The Open IPTV Forum XML schema is obtained by extending SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] and BCG [[!BCG]] schemas.</p>
<section id="metadata-extensibility">
<h4>Metadata Extensibility</h4>
<p>This specification provides schema descriptions of those elements and attributes that are extended from original schema defined in [[!SDNS]] for SD&amp;S or [[!BCG]] for BCG. The extension rule adopted in this specification follows the &ldquo;forward compatibility&rdquo; constraints specified for extending BCG Schema [[!TVA-UNID]].</p>
</section>
<section id="metadata-validation">
<h4>Metadata Validation</h4>
<p>No specific XSD validation tool is mentioned in [[!SDNS]] for SD&amp;S or [[!BCG]] for BCG. Content that is purported to conform to the extension specified in this specification must pass a validation test using any widely-accepted XSD validation engine. In cases where the narrative description of this specification conflicts with the extended schema, the narrative will be considered authoritative. A companion schema (.xsd) documents associated with this specification provides the consolidated XML schema definition of SD&amp;S and BCG metadata extended as the Open IPTV Forum metadata.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="sdns-extensions">
<h3>SD&amp;S (Service Discovery and Selection) Extensions</h3>
<p>This clause describes the Open IPTV Forum extensions to the SD&amp;S schema described in [[!SDNS]] in conjunction with the generic application signalling defined in [[!TS102809]]. SD&amp;S records provide an XML-based description of Service Providers and their Services. They enable OITFs to discover and select appropriate services. In addition to [[!TS102809]], the Open IPTV Forum provides extensions which provide a means to signal web-based applications from within SD&amp;S records. There are also Open IPTV Forum extensions provided for</p><ul>
<li>Bandwidth renegotiation,
<li>Purchasing a Broadcast Service,
<li>Indicating Container Format.
</ul>
<p>For FCC/RET, no extensions are required, but the definition of one SD&amp;S element is extended in order to indicate to the OITF to use the cookie signalling method for FCC/RET services, without breaking the interpretation of this SD&amp;S element for non-OIPF deployments.</p>
<p>All schema extensions are described in Annex <a href="#sdns-schema-extension" class="sectionRef"></a>. For details of the original SD&amp;S schema, please see [[!SDNS]].</p>
<section id="service-provider-discovery-extensions">
<h4>Service Provider Discovery Extensions</h4>
<p>Service Provider Discovery information contains information about Service Providers including references to the Service offerings as along with any OIPF specific services (e.g. emergency notification service) they provide. Further details of the Service Provider XML schema can be found in clause 5.2.13.7 of [[!SDNS]].</p>
<p>The Service Provider Type is extended by Open IPTV Forum to signal the access information for the Emergency Notification service.</p>
<p>The schema for the extension is provided in Annex <a href="#sdns-serviceprovidertype-schema" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>

</figure>
<section id="emergency-notification-service">
<h5>Emergency Notification Service</h5>
<p>EmergencyNotificationService contains SDP-based session description that the terminal needs in order to receive emergency notification message. Two methods are used to carry session information:</p><ul>
<li>Inline: where the SDP file is inlined in the Service Provider XML document as element content. This is useful for situations where the contents of the SDP file are fixed.
<li>Out of band: where the SDP file is delivered independently of the Service Provider XML document. This is useful for situations where the contents of the SDP file are not necessarily fixed. In this case, the SDP file can be delivered via unicast or multicast. 
</ul>
<p>For unicast, an URL is provided; for multicast, a SDPStream together with a SDPURI are provided.
The schema for the extension is provided in Annex <a href="#sdns-emergencynotificationservice-schema" class="sectionRef"></a>. The following table provides a description of the parameters.</p>

<section id="service-discovery-extensions">
<h4>Service Discovery Extensions</h4>
<p>Service Discovery records provide descriptive information about and access details to the services (e.g. service name, service URL, etc.) offered by a service provider, for example, linear TV broadcasts or BCG(s).</p>
<p>Three types of extension are defined by the Open IPTV Forum:</p><ul>
<li>Bandwidth renegotiation
<li>Purchasing broadcast services
<li>Indicating Container Format
</ul>

<section id="bandwidth-renegotiation">
<h5>Bandwidth Renogiation</h5>
<p>The MaxBitrate element in the IPService Record of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] SHALL be provided in case of scheduled content services with SIP session management provided in managed networks relying on IMS. It is used during session initiation or session modification to ensure that the necessary bandwidth is available in the network.</p>

<table class="simple" id="maxbitrate-in-bdr">
<caption>Table ####: Extract of Broadcast Discovery Record Indicating MaxBitrate Extension</caption>
<tr><th>Element / Attribute Name</th><th>Element / Attribute Description</th><th>Mandated/ Optional</th></tr>
<tr><td><i>BroadcastOffering type:</i></td><td colspan="2"><i>/BroadcastDiscovery</i></td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left:1cm"><i>IPService type (one entry per service):</i></td><td colspan="2"><i>/BroadcastDiscovery/ServiceList/SingleService</i></td></tr>
<tr><td style="padding-left:2cm">MaxBitrate</td><td>Specifies the maximum bitrate of the overall stream carrying the service.</td><td>O</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The IPService Record of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] is extended for scheduled content services with SIP session management with an optional TimeToRenegotiate element that when present is used to determine when down-sizing of the reserved bandwidth for the content session is performed.</p>
<p>See Annex <a href="#sdns-IPServiceType-schema" class="sectionRef"></a> for the IPServiceType schema extension.</p>
<table class="simple" id="timetorenegotiate-in-bdr">

<tr><td style="padding-left:2cm">TimeToRenegotiate</td><td>This element provides the duration in seconds to be used in conjunction with MaxBitrate to determine when renegotiation of network bandwidth is to occur.</td><td>O</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Each service is represented by an IPService structure in the Broadcast Discovery Record. When the service is changed, typically through a user initiated channel change request, the TimeToRenegotiate value will be used for scheduled content services with SIP session management in conjunction with the MaxBitrate to determine how bandwidth re-negotiation will be performed.</p>
<p>Note that at every channel change if there is a pending timeout for session modification due to a previous service change then it is cancelled. The OITF may initiate a new session modification as described below.</p>
<p>The TimeToRenegotiate element SHOULD only be provided in an IPService structure representing a scheduled content service with SIP session management. When the TimeToRenegotiate element is provided with the IPService record then</p><ul>
<li>If the MaxBitrate of the new service is greater than the reserved bandwidth, network bandwidth reservation using the MaxBitrate of the new service SHALL occur immediately to ensure sufficient bandwidth is made available for the new service.
<li>If the MaxBitrate of the new service is equal to the reserved bandwidth, network bandwidth reservation procedures SHALL NOT be performed as sufficient bandwidth is already available for the new service.
<li>If the MaxBitrate of the new service is less than the reserved bandwidth, network bandwidth reservation using the MaxBitrate of the new service SHALL occur after the period (in seconds) provided by the TimeToRenegotiate element of the new service.
</ul>
</section>
<section id="purchasing-broadcast-services">
<h5>Purchasing Broadcast Services</h5>
<p>The IPService Record of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] is extended to include an optional PurchaseItem element. The PurchaseItem element allows conditions to be placed on the availability of purchased content.</p>
<p>See Annex <a href="#sdns-IPServiceType-schema" class="sectionRef"></a> for the IPServiceType schema extension.</p>

<table class="simple" id="purchaseitem-in-bdr">

</section>

<section id="container-format-indication">
<h5>Container Format Indication</h5>
<p>The IPService Record of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] is extended to include an optional FileFormat element as defined in &ldquo;AVAttributesType&rdquo; defined in clause 6.3.5 of TV-Anytime specification [[!TVA]]. This element provides a means to indicate file format.</p>
<p>See Annex <a href="#sdns-IPServiceType-schema" class="sectionRef"></a> for the IPServiceType schema extension.</p>
<table class="simple" id="fileformat-in-bdr">

<tr><td style="padding-left:2cm">FileFormat</td><td>This element provides a means to indicate file format.</td><td>O</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The FileFormat element SHALL be provided in case of scheduled content services with SIP session management provided in networks relying on IMS, to signal the use of SIP session management.</p>
</section>

<section id="fcc-ret-definition">
<h5>FCC/RET Attribute Definition</h5>
<p>The SD&amp;S FCC/RET attributes are defined in [[!FCC]].</p>
<table class="simple" id="ret-and-fec-in-bdr">
<caption>Table ####: Extract of Broadcast Discovery Record indicating redefined FCC/RET attributes</caption>
<thead><tr><th>Element / Attribute Name</th><th>Element / Attribute Description</th><th>Mandated/ Optional</th></tr></thead>

<tr><td style="padding-left:2cm">Retransmission_session@DestinationPort</td><td>See below Open IPTV extended definition</td><td>O</td></tr>
</table>
<p>The Retransmission_session@DestinationPort SD&amp;S attribute defined in [[!FCC]] shall be interpreted by an OITF as</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;UDP Destination Port of unicast RTP Retransmission session packets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the Retransmission_session@DestinationPort attribute is not present, AND neither is the Retransmission_session@SourcePort attribute, the destination port of unicast RTP Retransmission session packets matches the source port of the RTCP packets issued by the OITF for RTCP reporting in the primary/original multicast session.</p>
<p>If the Retransmission_session@DestinationPort attribute is not present, but the Retransmission_session@SourcePort attribute is present, the destination port for the FCC/RET packets may be determined by means of an in-band RTCP port mapping request message exchange of the OITF with the FCC/RET server on the port Retransmission_session@SourcePort (using symmetrical RTP, with RTP and RTCP mixed on a single port).</p>
<p>This means that when the OITF must operate according to the cookie signaling method, the Retransmission_session@DestinationPort attribute SHALL NOT be present, whereas the Retransmission_session@SourcePort attribute SHALL be present, with the latter indicating the destination port on which the OITF must issue its port mapping request message.</p>

<section id="application-announcement-and-signalling">
<h4>Application Announcement &amp; Signaling</h4>
<p>This section describes how to signal applications with [[!TS102809]]. Two types of applications can be signalled; service provider related applications and broadcast related applications. Those two types of applications SHALL be signalled either at the phase of Service Provider Discovery or Service Discovery Record such as Broadcast Discovery Record, Package Discovery Record, and Application Discovery Record.</p>
<p>In the Service Provider Discovery record, a service provider can only signal service provider related applications. However, in the service discovery phase, both service provider related applications and broadcast related applications can be signalled. The detailed description of how to signal is described in the following sections.</p>
<p>The definition of XML schema for signalling applications is defined in [[!TS102809]].</p>

<section id="service-provider-related-application-signalling">
<h5>Service Provider Related Application Signalling</h5>
<p>There are two approaches to signal service provider related applications. One approach is to use the AbstractService element at the Service Provider Discovery Record level. The other approach is to use the Application Discovery Record at the service discovery level.</p>
<p>For signalling service provider related applications with the AbstractService element, the Service Provider Discovery Record SHALL embed applications information in the ApplicationList element defined in [[!TS102809]] where they are referred to as &ldquo;unbound applications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Service Provider Discovery Record SHALL embed application reference id values in the ApplicationList element defined in [[!TS102809]] for signalling the broadcast independent applications with the Application Discovery Record. The actual information of applications SHALL be described in the Application Discovery Record. When OITF receives the Service Provider Discovery Record and the Application Discovery Record, OITF SHALL link the application reference id values in the Service Provider Discovery Record to the application identifier values in the Application Discovery Record.</p>
<p>If a service provider wants to signal the below applications with these two approaches, the ApplicationUsage value defined in section <a href="#applicationusage-in-applicationusagedescriptor" class="sectionRef"></a> SHALL be used with the application location value defined in section <a href="#applicationspecificdescriptor-extensions" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>ServiceDiscovery Application &mdash; Application containing IPTV service discovery information like a service provider's web portal page. In case of DAE application, this application can contain other service applications such as communication application or content guide application.
<li>Communication Application &mdash; Application for communication service. In case of DAE application, this application enables communication service
<li>EPG Application &mdash; Application for EPG service. In case of DAE application, this application can be either a grid-type epg application or a mosaic epg application.
<li>VoD Application &mdash; Application for VoD service. VoD application can also include content information for downloadable contents.
<li>Non-native HNI-IGI Application &mdash; Application that implements the HNI-IGI interface functionality via a DAE application.
</ul>
</section>

<section id="broadcast-related-application-signalling">
<h5>Broadcast Related Application Signalling</h5>
<p>There are two approaches to signal broadcast related applications. One approach is to use either the extended IPService element in the Broadcast Discovery Record or the extended Package element in the Package Discovery Record. The other approach is to use the Application Discovery Record at the service discovery level. Broadcast related applications SHALL NOT be signalled with the Service Provider Discovery Record.</p>
<p>For signalling broadcast related applications with the extended IPService and Package elements, the Broadcast Discovery Record and the Package Discovery Record SHALL embed applications information in the ApplicationList element defined in [[!TS102809]] where they are referred to as &ldquo;Service bound application.&rdquo; The extended IPService and Package element are defined in [[!TS102809]].</p>
<p>When broadcast related applications are signalled with the Application Discovery Record, the extended IPService element in the Broadcast Discovery Record and the extended Package element in the Package Discovery Record SHALL embed application reference id values in the ApplicationList element defined in [[!TS102809]].

<p>In all examples the SOAP and HTTP wrappers are omitted for clarity.</p>
<section>
<h6>get_Data (informative)</h6>
<p>The get_Data method allows a client to query a server in order to retrieve BCG data for a set of programmes or programme groups. The flexibility of the query syntax enables simple or complex queries to best restrict the set and size of the metadata response. For example, a simple query could request program information for a specific content identifier or program title. Alternatively, more powerful queries can be generated by combining these simple queries, for example, to create an EPG a request can be made for all program and schedule information across a range of services between specific dates. Content resolution can also be performed using the same method to retrieve content referencing information for one or more content identifiers.</p>
<p>Optional parameters are available to limit the number of results (e.g. 10 results) and to sort them (e.g., sort alphabetically by title). Support for these features is optional on the server and indicated to the client in a describe_Get_Data response (see Example 4 in clause <a href="#describe_get_data-example" class="sectionRef"></a>).</p>
<p>The query mechanism is fully defined in clause 5.1 of TV-Anytime specification [[!TVA-BID]], with many examples of potential requests given in Annex C of TV-Anytime specification [[!TVA-BID]].</p>
<p>The following is an example client get_Data request for the program information of all programs with a title equal to &ldquo;News&rdquo;:</p>

<h4>Event Information Tables (EIT)</h4>
<p>This section is related to the extension of TS Optional SI profile with EIT p/f (without SDT). The scope of this section is to allow an OITF to retrieve metadata embedded in a DVB Transport Stream.</p>
<p>A unicast mechanism for metadata retrieval can provoke server overload when a large number of OITFs try to access the same information at the same time (i.e. request information for an event during frequent channel changes). As EITs are synchronized with the content at TV head end level, EIT allows the OITF to have up-to-date information even if the content changes at the last minute or is longer than originally defined (e.g., prolongation in a football match) without any request to a server. The information contained in EIT can be used, for example, to show the title and duration of an item of content in a zapper application.</p>
<p>For IPTV services, if the OITF is able to use EIT embedded in a DVB Transport Stream, then the following section applies. This section is restricted to DVB world and is only applicable for MPEG-2 Transport Streams.</p>
<p>The EIT p/f contains metadata concerning events such as event name, start time, duration, etc. These metadata related to a piece of contents should be transported and synchronized directly into the transport stream using the EITs tables as describe in DVB-SI specification [[!DVBSI]].</p>
<p>For Open IPTV Forum, EIT information is restricted to the following two main types of table:</p><ul>
<li>actual TS, present/following event information = table_id = "0x4E";
<li>other TS, present/following event information = table_id = "0x4F";
</ul>
<p>The schedule informations table_id = "0x5F" and "0x6F" are not in the scope of this specification.</p>

<h5>How to optimize the transport of EIT p/f (informative)</h5>
<p>This section is an informative part that provides guidance in order to optimize the transport of EIT p/f actual/other tables over IP in MPEG-2 TS.</p>
<p>In this specification the usage of EIT p/f Actual TS and Other TS can be optimized to give the Open IPTV Forum user a better user experience. To achieve this goal, the cycle time of the EIT p/f actual TS can be reduced to 1second and a Service Provider may also choose to send more than one EIT p/f Actual table by SPTS.</p>
<p>Sending more than one EIT p/f Actuals tables allows the Service Provider to send a set of metadata related to some channels that are frequently used, at a quick cycle time (e.g. 1 or 2 second). For other channels that are less frequently viewed EIT p/f can be sent at a lower cycle time by using the EIT p/f other tables.</p>

<h3>Link between SD&amp;S and BCG (informative)</h3>
<p>This clause details how to link from SD&amp;S metadata [[!SDNS]] to BCG [[!BCG]] metadata, useful for creating EPGs (Electronic Program Guides). More detailed definitions and descriptions can be found in SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]], BCG [[!BCG]], and TV-Anytime specification [[!TVA]].</p>
<p>The SD&amp;S metadata describes all services for each service provider such as broadcasting services, CoD services, BCG services, and so on. BCG metadata describes detailed information about pieces of content and services. If BCG service information is present, it SHALL take precedence over SD&amp;S service information as described in clause 6.6 of BCG [[!BCG]].</p>
<p>In order to make an EPG, some elements of SD&amp;S metadata information and BCG metadata information should be linked.</p>
<section id="locating-a-bcg">
<h4>Locating a BCG for a Service using SD&amp;S</h4>
<p>Access to a BCG service is described in a BCG Discovery Record, which is linked to from a Broadcast Discovery Record. To enable this, the following SD&amp;S elements should be used:</p><ul>
<li>Broadcast Discovery<ul>
<li>URI identifier of a BCG Discovery record. Either:<ul>
<li><i>BroadcastDiscovery/SI/ServiceDescriptionLocation</i> or
<li><i>BroadcastDiscovery/ServicesDescriptionLocation</i>
</ul></ul></ul>
<p>In accordance with clause 5.2.13.2 of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]], if present, SI/ServiceDescriptionLocation shall take precedence. Furthermore, if more than one BCG Discovery record is specified, a single preferred record may optionally be signalled using the &ldquo;preferred&rdquo; attribute.</p><ul>
<li>BCG Discovery<ul>
<li>Identifier of BCG Record<ul>
<li><i>BCGDiscovery/BCG@Id</i>
</ul>
<li>One of delivery information of BCG metadata<ul>
<li><i>BCGDiscovery/TransportMode/DVBSTP</i>
<li><i>BCGDiscovery/TransportMode/HTTP@Location</i> or <i>BCGDiscovery/TransportMode/HTTP@SOAP</i>
</ul></ul></ul>
<p>Figure <a href="#link-a-service-in-bcg" class="figureRef"></a> indicates how to receive BCG metadata relating to a single service or a couple of services in Broadcast Discovery information. In order to signal BCG metadata for a single service or services' list, the value of &ldquo;ServiceDescriptionLocation&rdquo; or &ldquo;ServicesDescriptionLocation&rdquo; in Broadcast Discovery must be the same. The transport address of BCG metadata is described in the children nodes of &ldquo;TransportMode&rdquo; element in the BCG Discovery. With this address, the OITF can receive BCG metadata for a single service or a couple of services (either through push or pull container based mechanism, or through SOAP querying).</p>

<h4>Linking SD&amp;S Service Information with BCG</h4>
<p>The BCG Discovery record allows the OITF to receive all BCG metadata relating to a single service or a couple of services.</p>
<p>To create an EPG, for example, with the received BCG metadata and SD&amp;S metadata, the following BCG metadata elements should be used:</p><ul>
<li>ServiceInformationTable<ul>
<li><i>TVAMain/ProgramDescription/ServiceInformationTable/ServiceInformation@serviceId</i><ul>
<li>Unique Identifier of Service whose syntax is defined in clause 5.2.1.2 of SD&amp;S [[!SDNS]] - equals the ServiceName attribute in the associated SD&amp;S Broadcast Discovery record (See clause 6.4 in BCG [[!BCG]]).
</ul></ul>
<li>Schedule Element in ProgramLocationTable<ul>
<li><i>ProgramLocationTable/Schedule@serviceIDRef</i><ul>
<li>Reference of a serviceId
<li><i>serviceIDRef</i> value must be the same as the associated <i>serviceId</i> in <i>ServiceInformationTable</i>
</ul>
<li><i>ProgramLocationTable/Schedule/ScheduleEvent/Program@crid</i><ul>
<li>CRID information of a program in a service. Provides link to detailed program description, found in the ProgramInformationTable.
</ul>
<li><i>ProgramLocationTable/Schedule/ScheduleEvent/PublishedStartTime</i><ul>
<li>Advertised start time of a single program in a service
</ul>
<li><i>ProgramLocationTable/Schedule/ScheduleEvent/PublishedDuration</i><ul>
<li>Advertised duration of a single program.
</ul></ul>
<li>ProgramInformationTable<ul>
<li><i>ProgramInformationTable/ProgramInformation@programId</i><ul>
<li>CRID value of a single program
<li><i>programId</i> value should be the same with one of CRID values in ProgramLocationTable
</ul></ul></ul>
<p>Figure <a href="#description-information-in-bcg" class="figureRef"></a> describes how to find description information in BCG from a single service of Broadcast Discovery. Service information in SD&amp;S and BCG metadata is linked as described in clause 6.4 of BCG [[!BCG]] (BCG ServiceInformation@serviceId = SD&amp;S BroadcastDiscovery ServiceName attribute). Once the serviceId value in ServiceInformationTable is found, a single service's schedule events can be retrieved from the ProgramLocationTable. Then, Program@CRIDs in ScheduleEvent values can be used to find detailed information of a single content by referencing ProgramInformation@programId.</p>

<img alt="Figure 7" src="images/DescriptionInformationInBCG.png" style="width:90%" />
<figcaption>Figure ####: How to Find Description Information in BCG from SD&amp;S Metadata</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In summary, an OITF can receive a single service, for example broadcaster1, from SD&amp;S's Broadcast Discovery record. With BCG@Id value in BCG Discovery, the OITF can collect BCG metadata which has all EPG information of <b><i>broadcaster1</i></b> service. OITF compares serviceId values in ServiceInformationTable of BCG metadata in order to find a match with the same value of broadcaster1's ServiceName attribute of Broadcast Discovery record. Once OITF finds the same service from the ServiceInformationTable, OITF can find the ScheduleEvents of <b><i>broadcaster1</i></b>'s service, allowing the OITF to create the EPG's time table of a single channel. The detailed information of a single event can be described by BasicDescription using ProgramInformation@programId of ProgramInformationTable.</p>

<section id="crid-location-resolution">
<h3>CRID Location Resolution</h3>
<p>BCG CRID Location Resolution is the process of mapping a CRID to other CRIDs (e.g. for a series) or to a Locator (e.g. RTSP URL). A Locator provides accurate location and timing information for where and when to retrieve the content.</p>
<p>The OITF that supports BCG SHALL support content resolution:</p><ul>
<li>The OITF MAY support terminal-side resolution. If so, it SHALL be delivered using the container-based mechanisms, as specified by clause 5 of BCG [[!BCG]].
<li>The OITF SHALL support server-side resolution using the protocol defined in [[!TVA-BID]].
</ul>
<p>A service provider MAY provide content resolution information.</p>

<section>
<h4>CoD Service with SIP session management</h4>
<p>The BCG provides two approaches to identifying each instance of content (e.g. HD and SD versions of <i>InterestingMovie</i>):</p><ol>
<li>one CRID per instance (e.g. a &ldquo;HD InterestingMovie CRID&rdquo; and an &ldquo;SD InterestingMovie CRID&rdquo;)
<li>one CRID for the content (e.g. a &ldquo;InterestingMovie CRID&rdquo;) and two IMIs for each instance (e.g. a &ldquo;HD IMI&rdquo; and an &ldquo;SD IMI&rdquo;); the combination of CRID and IMI identifies the appropriate instance.
</ol>
<p>It is a service provider decision as to which approach is used.</p>
<p>To enable either approach to be used for Content on Demand services using SIP session management provided in managed networks relying on IMS, CoD session setup and initiation SHALL use the CRID and an Instance Metadata Identifier (where one exists) in conjunction with the process defined in <a href="volume4.html#s5-3-2" class="extRef">clause 5.3.2</a> of the Protocol specification [[.OIPF_PROT2]].</p>
<p>This clause defines the format of the wild card portion of the &ldquo;Request URI&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The wild card part (*) of the Request URI SHALL be constructed from the CoD's CRID and Instance Metadata Identifier (IMI), as signalled in the BCG, in accordance with the following format, as specified in clause 12.1.4 of [[!DVBTRANS]]</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code>&lt;CRID&gt;[#&lt;IMI&gt;]</code></p>
<p>As a CRID is composed of an &lt;authority&gt; and &lt;data&gt; section and an IMI is composed of a &lt;name&gt; and &lt;data&gt; section, the above construction can be represented in greater detail as:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code>&lt;CRID_authority&gt;/&lt;CRID_data&gt;[#[&lt;IMI_name&gt;/]&lt;IMI_data&gt;]</code></p>
<p>The &ldquo;CRID://&rdquo; and &ldquo;imi:&rdquo; portions of the respective identifiers SHALL be omitted.</p>
<p>The IMI portion of the Request URI is optional; however, if an IMI is signalled in the BCG for a CoD instance, it SHALL be included in the Request URI.</p>
<p>For example:<br />
In the case where the HD version of InterestingMovie is signalled with a CRID of &ldquo;CRID://newstudio.com/InterestingMovieHD&rdquo;, the wild card part of the Request URI would be:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code>newstudio.com/InterestingMovieHD</code></p>
<p>If however, InterestingMovie is signalled with a CRID of &ldquo;CRID://newstudio.com/InterestingMovie&rdquo;, and has a HD instance with the IMI: &ldquo;imi:hd&rdquo;, the wild card part of the Request URI for the HD instance would be:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code>newstudio.com/InterestingMovie#hd</code></p>

<p>In this example, a single service provider is indicated by the name &ldquo;<code>Service Provider</code>&rdquo; with an offering titled &ldquo;<code>Service Provider IPTV Offer</code>&rdquo; and the domain &ldquo;<code>tv.service.com</code>&rdquo;. A logo file for the Service Provider's offering is available at the URL specified by the LogoURI attribute. Information for the OITF to connect to the Emergency Service Notifications from the Service Provider can be retrieved from the URL specified in the <code>EmergencyNotificationService</code> element.</p>
<p>Three service types are available to the terminal</p><ul>
<li>Broadcast Discovery, designated by <code>Payload Id="02"</code>
<li>Package Discovery, designated by <code>Payload Id="05"</code>
<li>Application Discovery, designated by <code>Payload Id="C1"</code>
</ul>
<p>Information on the Payload Id values are given in clause 5.4.4.1 of [[!SDNS]].</p>
</section>
<section id="bdr-example"><h3>Broadcast Discovery</h3>
<p>If the Service Provider Discovery record indicates that Broadcast Discovery information is available (i.e. there is a <code>dvb:Offering</code> with <code>Payload Id="02"</code>) about the Scheduled Content Services offered by the Service Provider, further interrogation by the OITF is required. This procedure would also be utilized when updated Broadcast Discovery records are available according to section <a href="#update-mechanism-for-sdns" class="sectionRef"></a>.</p>
<p>In the Service Provider information, the Broadcast Discovery records are retrievable by HTTP GET operation (the offering only provides a dvb:Pull mechanism), the OITF creates an HTTP request as follows</p>
<pre>GET /dvb/sdns/service_discovery?id=tv.service.com&amp;Payload=02&amp;Segment=0001&amp;Version=01 
HOST: 195.238.226.223</pre>
<p>The HTTP response will contain the Broadcast Discovery records similar to those in the following XML instance document</p>
