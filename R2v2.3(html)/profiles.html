<section id="abstract">
<p>This specification has been produced by the Open IPTV Forum (OIPF).</p>
<p>This specification accompanies the set of specifications (Volumes 1-7) that define the Open IPTV Forum Release 2 IPTV Solution.</p>
<p>This specification defines three profiles for the OIPF Release 2 IPTV Solution:</p><ul>
<li>The Open Internet Profile,
<li>The Baseline Managed Profile, and
<li>The Enhanced Managed Profile.</ul>
<p>The three profiles are heirarchical in the sense that the Open Internet Profile is formed of a sub-set of the features of the Baseline Managed Profile, and that the Baseline Managed Profile is formed of a sub-set of the features of the Enhanced Managed Profile.</p>
<p>Note that these profile names are defined as technical terms and as such are not intended to be used for any logo mark or similar purpose.</p>
<p>If additional profiles are defined for the Release 2 IPTV Solution, these will be included in future revisions of this specification.</p>
</section>

<!--<section id='sotd'></section>-->

<section id="scope">
<h2>Scope (Informative)</h2>
<p>The Open IPTV Forum Release 2 IPTV Solution provides the specification for an end-to-end platform for the deployment of the set of Release 2 IPTV Services. The Open IPTV Forum has developed an end-to-end solution to allow any consumer end-device, compliant to the Open IPTV Forum specifications, to access enriched and personalised IPTV services either in a managed or a non-managed network.</p> 
<p>The Release 2 IPTV Solution specification provides multiple options for some features. This specification complements the IPTV Solution specification by defining OIPF implementation and deployment profiles that remove uncertainty about what features are required in an implementation. Any implementation based on the Release 2 IPTV Solution specification must be in adherence to one of the profiles defined in the present specification in order to claim Open IPTV Forum compliance.</p> 
<p>Profiles define the minimum set of features that a terminal must support in order to be able to claim compliance to that profile, and the maximum set of features that a service can rely on being present in the OITF. Some features are optional within a profile, and a service can use capability exchange protocols to determine if a terminal supports such features. Some features are mandatory or optional depending on the configuration of the OITF, for example whether the OITF is equipped with local storage or a broadcast tuner.</p> 
<p>It is expected that this specification will be used as a key input to the interoperability and certification programs that will be defined for the Release 2 Solution by the Open IPTV Forum.</p>

<h1>Release 2 IPTV Solution Profiles (Informative)</h1>
<p>An OIPF Release 2 IPTV Solution profile is a set of features and elements, as specified in the Open IPTV Forum Release 2 Solution specification, that will be used by any OIPF-defined interoperability and certification program to define equipment or services as being &ldquo;OIPF compliant&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The overall objective is to enable the best possible capability and flexibility for Service Providers to deploy Services to terminals that are available in the horizontal (i.e., non-subsidized) market in the near-term time frame. In selecting a set of features and elements that constitute a profile, a balance is made between the following factors:</p><ul>
<li>Time to market of the compliant OITF within a non-subsidised, horizontal-market device;
<li>Viability of implementation of the selected technologies;
<li>Flexibility in the provision of the envisaged Release 2 IPTV Services;
<li>Enabling a wide range of services to be accessible to the User.</ulL
<p>Three profiles are specified in the present document:</p><ul>
<li>The Open Internet Profile (OIP). This profile is intended for &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo; services that do not utilise any QoS provision or terminal management features.
<li>The Baseline Managed Profile (BMP). This profile adds support for multicast and unicast content streaming services including all associated features that facilitate QoS provision for content delivery in a managed network, compared to the OIP.
<li>The Enhanced Managed Profile (EMP). This profile adds native support for advanced managed-network features like IMS, Broadband Content Guide and TR-069 based remote management, compared to the BMP.</ul>
<p>Sections <a href="#oip" class="sectionRef">5</a>, <a href="#bmp" class="sectionRef">6</a> and <a href="#emp" class="sectionRef">7</a> provide normative descriptions of the OIP, BMP and EMP respectively.</p>
<p>Section <a href="#profile-features" class="sectionRef">8</a> provides a normative specification of the set of features of each Profile in tabular form, with cross-references to the relevant clauses of the volumes in the Release 2 IPTV Solution specification.</p>
<p>It is believed that Sections <a href="#oip" class="sectionRef">5</a>, <a href="#bmp" class="sectionRef">6</a> and <a href="#emp" class="sectionRef">7</a> are consistent with Section <a href="#profile-features" class="sectionRef">8</a>, but in the case of an inadvertent discrepancy, the normative requirements in section <a href="#profile-features" class="sectionRef">8</a> shall take precedence.</p>
</section>

<section id="oip"><h1>Open Internet Profile</h1>
<p>In the present document the Open Internet Profile is referred to as &ldquo;OIP&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An OITF that is compliant with the OIP is referred to as an OIP-OITF.</p>
<p>In the Release 2 IPTV Solution specification, the terms &ldquo;Unmanaged Network&rdquo; and &ldquo;Open Internet&rdquo; are used interchangeably, to refer to the ability to access any Service Provider using any Access Network Provider without any quality of service guarantees.</p>
<p>Open Internet IPTV Services are accessed via the Internet, without QoS guarantees. They may be accessed via a service platform (e.g., a portal).</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF enables access to compliant services that do not provide QoS guarantees over at least one network segment between the IPTV Service Provider and the OITF, independently from their ISP – i.e. &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; (OTT) mode.</p>
<p>The OIP is a sub-set of the BMP and of the EMP in terms of the features included.</p>
<p>The following sub-sections summarise the features of the OIP.</p>
<section id="oip-iptv-services"><h2>IPTV Services</h2>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL support the Scheduled Content Service, using the HTTP transport method. Support of the multicast and unicast streamed via RTSP/RTP variants is OPTIONAL.</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL support the Streamed CoD Service, using the HTTP transport method. Support of the Streamed CoD Service via RTSP/RTP is OPTIONAL.</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL support Information Services, which are realised as DAE applications.</p>
<p>Support for the Download CoD and Local PVR services in the OIP-OITF is OPTIONAL and depends on the provision of persistent storage in the OITF.</p>
<p>Support for the Hybrid Broadcast Broadband service in the OIP-OITF is OPTIONAL and depends on the provision of at least one broadcast tuner in the OITF.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-residential-network"><h2>Residential Network</h2>
<section id="oip-wg"><h3>WAN Gateway</h3>
<p>If an OIPF-compliant WAN Gateway is present then it MAY fulfill the relevant network attachment functions as specified in Volume 4 [[.OIPF_PROT2]] <a href="volume4.html#s12-1" class="extRef">section 12.1</a> in order to provide additional Service Provider discovery entry points as described in section <a href="#oip-sp-discovery" class="sectionRef">5.3</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-ig"><h3>IMS Gateway</h3>
<p>The IMS Gateway (IG) functional entity is not necessary for access to services not relying on IMS using an OIP-OITF. However, if an IG is present, an OIP-OITF MAY use it to access some IMS-based managed network services.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-ag"><h3>Application Gateway</h3>
<p>The AG functional entity, as generally for the IPTV Release 2 Solution, is OPTIONAL in the OIP.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-oitf"><h3>OITF</h3>
<p>The REQUIRED features for the OIP-OITF are described in the following sub-sections, which deal with specific aspects of the IPTV Solution.</p>
<p>Section <a href="#profile-features" class="sectionRef">8</a> provides details about the IPTV Solution features that SHALL be supported by the OIP-OITF.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="oip-sp-discovery"><h2>Service Provider discovery entry points</h2>
<p>The Release 2 IPTV Solution defines three methods for the provision of Service Provider discovery entry points to the OITF. The availability of these various methods enables the User to access various Service Providers' IPTV Services in a convenient manner, namely entry points that are pre-configured in the OITF, manually entered or acquired entry points, and entry points provided by the Access Network Service Provider.</p>
<p>The WAN Gateway MAY provide Service Provider discovery entry points via DHCP, as specified in Volume 4 [[.OIPF_PROT2]] <a href="volume4.html#s12-1-1-1-3" class="extRef">section 12.1.1.1.3</a>.</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF MAY provide pre-configured Service Provider discovery entry points, as specified in the Release 2 Architecture [[.OIPF_ARCH2]] <a href="architecture.html#s6-2-1-2" class="extRef">section 6.2.1.2</a>.</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF MAY provide means by which the User is able to enter his own chosen Service Provider discovery entry points via the OITF user interface, as specified in the Release 2 Architecture [[.OIPF_ARCH2]] <a href="architecture.html#s6-2-1-2" class="extRef">section 6.2.1.2</a>.</p>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL offer the complete set of Service Provider discovery entry points acquired by all of the three above methods, if any are provided, but the method of presentation and relative positioning of the various Service Provider discovery entry points in the user interface is out of scope of the OIPF specifications.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-service-discovery"><h2>Service discovery and content metadata</h2>
<p>If the OIP-OITF provides persistent storage and supports the Download CoD service then it SHALL support the provision of content metadata via the Content Access Descriptor for that service, otherwise all service discovery data and content metadata SHALL be embedded within the DAE application CE-HTML pages.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-authentication"><h2>Authentication methods</h2>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL support the following authentication methods specified in the indicated sections of Volume 7 [[.OIPF_CSP2]]:</p><ul>
<li>HTTP basic and digest authentication (Volume 7 [[.OIPF_CSP2]] <a href="volume7.html#http-basic-and-digest-authentication" class="extRef">section 5.4.1</a>), and
<li>Web based authentication (Volume 7 [[.OIPF_CSP2]] <a href="volume7.html#web-based-authentication" class="extRef">section 5.4.3</a>).
</ul>
</section>
<section id="oip-csp"><h2>Content and Service Protection</h2>
<p>The OIP-OITF SHALL support at least one of the CSP solutions specified in Volume 7 [[.OIPF_CSP2]], i.e. it SHALL support either the TCA and/or CSPG-DTCP and/or CSPG-CI+, in order to support compliant services that deliver protected content.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-svg"><h2>SVG Tiny V1.2</h2>
<p>The use of SVG Tiny 1.2 enables advanced graphics capabilities within a DAE application, but it is expected that not all terminals will be able to support SVG Tiny 1.2, hence the support of SVG Tiny 1.2 in the OIP-OITF is OPTIONAL.</p>
<p>A DAE application MAY use SVG Tiny 1.2 as specified in Volume 5 [[.OIPF_DAE2]], but it is RECOMMENDED that Service Providers ensure that an OITF that does not support SVG Tiny 1.2 is nevertheless able to offer the full functionality of the Service to the User, except for the enhanced user interface.</p>
</section>
<section id="oip-remote-management"><h2>Remote management</h2>
<p>The remote management feature for the OIP facilitates the function of basic inventory of OITFs that are accessing services, without the presence of a remote management server that provisions the OITF.</p>
<p>The OITF SHALL support the remote management API as specified in <a href="volume5.html#remote-management-apis" class="extRef">section 7.11</a> of Volume 5 [[.OIPF_DAE2]].</p>
<p>The OITF SHALL support an upgrade process that can be triggered via the DAE remote management API. The upgrade process remains manufacturer-specific and the provision of upgrades is subject to deployment needs.</p>
</section>
</section>


<section id="bmp"><h1>Baseline Managed Profile</h1>
<p>In the present document the Baseline Managed Profile is referred to as &ldquo;BMP&rdquo;.</p>
<p>An OITF that is compliant with the BMP is referred to as a BMP-OITF.</p>
<p>The BMP is a super-set of the OIP, and a sub-set of the EMP in terms of the features included. All features that are MANDATORY in the OIP are also MANDATORY in the BMP.</p>
<p>The BMP-OITF extends the functions needed to provide the pure &ldquo;Over-The-Top&rdquo; (OTT) service support of the OIP with functions that make it able to access content delivery services with full QoS provision in a managed network environment. These functions are chosen in order to allow a BMP-OITF to be able to access the full range of IPTV content services, and act as a near-term intermediate step towards the full range of capabilities offered by the Enhanced Managed Profile (EMP), described in section <a href="#emp" class="sectionRef">7</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, the BMP-OITF enables access to several kinds of IPTV Service:</p><ul>
<li>Compliant services that do not provide QoS guarantees over at least one network segment between the IPTV Service Provider and the OITF, independently from their ISP – i.e. &ldquo;over the top&rdquo; (OTT) mode;
<li>Services where the ISP is also an IPTV Service Provider that offers compliant services making use of network-side enhancements, including multicast and unicast content streaming with full QoS provision.</ul>
<p>The following sub-sections summarise the features of the BMP.</p>
<section id="bmp-iptv-services"><h2>IPTV Services</h2>
<p>IPTV services support in the BMP is the same as for the OIP, except that in addition to those services the BMP-OITF SHALL support the Scheduled Content and Streamed CoD Services, using the tools described in section <a href="#bmp-service-enablers" class="sectionRef">6.4</a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="bmp-residential-network"><h2>Residential Network</h2>
<section id="bmp-wg"><h3>WAN Gateway</h3>
<p>The WAN Gateway SHALL fulfill the relevant network attachment functions as specified in Volume 4 [[.OIPF_PROT2]] <a href="volume4.html#s12-1" class="extRef">section 12.1</a>.</p>
<p>If an OIPF compliant WAN Gateway is not present, for example when a non-OIPF compliant home broadband router is deployed instead, then the BMP-OITF might not be able to access the Scheduled Content and Streamed CoD services.</p>
</section>
<section id="bmp-ig"><h3>IMS Gateway</h3>
<p>The IMS Gateway (IG) functional entity is not necessary for access to services using a BMP-OITF. However, if an IG is present, a BMP-OITF MAY use it to access IMS-based managed network services.</p>
</section>
<section id="bmp-ag"><h3>Application Gateway</h3>
<p>The AG functional entity, as generally for the IPTV Release 2 Solution, is OPTIONAL in the BMP.</p>
</section>
<section id="bmp-oitf"><h3>OITF</h3>
<p>A DAE application in a BMP-OITF SHALL implement the non-native HNI-IGI interface, as specified in Volumes 4 [[.OIPF_PROT2]] and 5 [[.OIPF_DAE2]] of the Release 2 IPTV Solution specification, if it intends to make to use of IMS-based services.</p>
